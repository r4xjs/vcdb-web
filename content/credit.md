I want to thank all people that published the vulnerbilities which were collected on this site.
Each Challenge has a back-link to the location where the information was found to give full credit to the publisher.

Furhtermore, I want to thank the [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) devs and [panr](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) for developing hugo and the hugo-theme-terminal respectifly. The website would look (much more) afful if I started from scratch ;-).
