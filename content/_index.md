# Vulnerable Code Database (VCDB)

The VCDB is a collection of vulnerable code samples from across the net.
It is meant as a training resource for spotting security issues by reading source code. 
Each challenge includes a download link for further offline processing.

Contributions like [new-challenges](contribution/) or found mistakes are always welcome, just create a new
issue (or even better a pull request) at <https://github.com/r4xjs/vcdb>.
